Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The S3 does not enabled encryption, the attacker can easily get all the version unenscripted of files store in S3 if they have read access.
- Solution: need to enable default encryption to S3.

# Poor practice 2
These Security Groups using CIDRIP 0.0.0.0/0. That accept all incoming connection request.
- Solution: need to apply rules to control and limit the traffic request.
